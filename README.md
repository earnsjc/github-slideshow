# Hello-world

Whats up world!!!

Im Ernesto Javier.  I am brand new to all of this and do not know a thing about open source or coding.  But I am here to learn and see what I can bring and add to the table.  Ultimately I want to learn then give back.  Over the past decade I have invested in making positive changes to my mind, body and spirit.  I have been very fortunate to have found people who invested in me and gave me opportunities which have led to my growth.  I am now in a stage of my life where my mission in life is to live full of joy, connection, contribution, ENTHUSIASM, Love and be a force for good!  I want to help others see in themselves what others have seen in me.  I guess this is the perfect place because in order to help others I will need help from others.  I look forward to creating something special with all.
